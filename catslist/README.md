# Catslistâ„¢

> List your cats. Lend your cats. Borrow others' cats.

## How To Start This App

************************************
Step 0: Clone the repo to your local machine.

Step 1: In your terminal, run ```npm install``` from the directory in which the repo has been cloned. This will install several modules required by the app, including angular, body-parser, express, and mongoose.

Step 2: Make sure you have an instance of mongoDB running in your terminal. You can do this by running the mongod command in your terminal.

Step 3: From the terminal, inside the repo folder, run ```node ./seed.js``` to seed the mongoDB instance with the collection of cats.

Step 4: In your terminal, run ```npm start``` from the repo folder to start the server. The server is set to listen on port 3000.

Step 5: With the server running on your local machine, you may now visit `localhost:3000` to use the app.

## Requirements

Implement a full-stack application based on the images in `mockups/`

- [ ] Use Angular, Backbone, or React to create a single page front-end. Feel free to use any CSS libraries you wish
- [ ] Use a Node server (with Express if you'd like)
- [ ] Use a SQL or Mongo database to persist all data (with ORMs if you'd like)
- [ ] Fill out the script, `seed.js`, that is responsible for seeding your database with example data from `data.json`
- [ ] Fill out the [How To Start This App](#how-to-start-this-app) section with instructions that can be understood by another developer

Additionally, be sure to update `.gitignore` if you choose to move the installation location of `node_modules` or `bower_components`
