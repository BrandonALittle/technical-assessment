# The Technical Assessment

Ready to put your skills to the test and have some full-stack hacking fun? This assessment is like a day long solo sprint where you get to build a full stack JavaScript application using the skills and technologies you've worked with during the first half of the course. Expect to reinforce concepts and techniques you are familiar with and also to learn some new content.

## Guidelines

You must manage your time effectively to complete this assessment. This assessment will be evaluated as if it was a coding challenge given to you as part of a job application process. Not only will the functionality of your code be important, but also, the professionalism with which you write it. Consider the style and organization of your code. Make frequent commits with informative and consistent commit messages. Be professional and informative with your comments.

Each directory contains a prompt with work for you to complete, with instructions defined in their own README.

## Available resources

The ultimate goal of this assessment is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your abilities as an engineer. Avoid anything that will obscure our ability and your ability to see your best efforts at work will undermine that goal.

* You **may not** use a scaffolding tool (e.g. Yeoman) or starter repos
* You **may not** use any resources created at Hack Reactor by yourself, other students, or staff members
  * e.g. lectures, sprints, MVP, past assessments, side projects, notes, mentor assignments, etc.
* You **may** only use online resources specifically allowed in a prompt's README
* You **may not** copy and paste from available online resources
* You **may** contact help desk, especially for any dev environment issues, but they may reserve the right to say "we can't answer your question."

## Submitting Your Work

Your work will be submitted with the `submit.sh` script located in the root directory of this repo. At 5:00pm (or beforehand if you finish early):

1. Make a final commit
2. Fill out the `closing_comments.txt` file.
3. Commit the changes to `closing_comments.txt` and `README.md`.
  - NOTE: This commit should only contain changes to these two files - no other changes are allowed
4. Run the script `bash submit.sh` from the same directory this `README.md` is located in to submit your code.
  - Contact help desk when the script instructs you to do so.
5. Upon receiving the :+1:, confirm with the HiR assisting you that your submission was received.
